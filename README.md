A simple bot made for my own personal use
Basic functionality: 
Once the bot is added to a server, it begins reading the chat configured in the script, if a post (an image, gif or a video) is dedected, the bot adds 2 interactive emojis for the users to vote on.
Once 24h has past, the bot picks the most voted content and posts it into a different chat to highligth it as an embed.
